# Energy_Consumption_Forecasting_using_DL_and_ML

This ipynb file contains the code for time series forecasting the Energy Generation and Consumption in a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Deep Learning models like RNN, LSTM and GRU are used for forecasting, and performed very well. On the other hand, ML models like SVM, Random Forests and XGBoost did not perform very well.
